# GT6-MW Geology Marker

This mod is based on Prospector's Journal by [CanisArtorus](https://github.com/CanisArtorus) and adds integration between [GregTech6](https://github.com/GregTech6/gregtech6) and [MapWriterUnofficial](https://github.com/IdealIndustrial/MapWriterUnofficial).
Instead of creating markers of ores on map manually this mod will add them automatically, when you pick up corresponding rock from surface (or right-click flower that marks bedrock veins).
Supports regular veins, bedrock veins and stone layers (this one is disabled by default).

Many thanks to the author of original Prospector's Journal mod for the inspiration (and some code :) ), GregTech6 developers for making existence of this mod possible, IIA developers for enhanced MapWriter version, and GTNH team for gradle workspace.
